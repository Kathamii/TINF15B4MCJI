## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software, and is the top-level plan generated and used by managers to direct the test effort.
This Test Plan for Fact Racing supports the following objectives:
- Outlines the testing approach that will be used
- Identifies the required resources

### 1.2 Scope
This document addresses the following types and levels of testing:
- Java JUnit Tests
- Functional Tests

### 1.3 Intended Audience
The intended audience of the test plan are the project members and developers.

| Technique Objective:    | Testing the webpages for correct behavior            | 
| Technique:              | Create or modify tests for each window to verify proper navigation and object states for each application window and object. | 
| Oracles:                | Tests are successful if every interaction with the GUI could be performed and produces an logical answer. | 
| Required Tools:         | Cucumber                                             |

## 8. Testing Workflow
User interface tests and function tests are executed at every push to the repository.

We integrated Sonarqube into our testing workflow. Every push onto the master and develop-branch will trigger a Sonarqube update. On our [Sonarqube-Page](https://sonarqube.com/organizations/factracing/projects) are many information and metrics related to our code provided.
