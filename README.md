# Fact Racing

Software Engineering Java quiz game project.

## General

A racing quiz game with at least 2 players. You are given a limited amount of time in which you need to answer as many question as possible correctly. The amount of questions is limited, so purely choosing random answers is not worthwhile. The winner is whoever got the most questions right.

## Instructions

1. Create a game room on your own or follow a link.
2. In the game room the creator can choose the decks for the game.
3. Use the chat to communicate with other players.
4. Once everybody is ready the creator can switch to the game view.
5. There you can play as many rounds as you want.
6. Each round lasts for 60 seconds and has a set of 12 questions each.
7. The goal is to answer as many questions correctly in the given amount of time.
8. Once the time elapsed the round is over.
9. The winner is the player that answered the most questions correctly.
