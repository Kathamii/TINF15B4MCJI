Software Engineering Java board game project.

## General

A board game with a 6x10 field and between 2-4 players moving on the board. A dice throw (1-6) determines how many fields a player can move at a time. Fields can have a question attached to them that the player currently on the field has to answer. Answering questions correctly awards you points that you need in order to win the game as well as allowing you to sometimes take shortcuts.

## Rules

- Everybody starts on the same starting field
- Starting player is decided at random
- Each player has to throw a dice each turn unless they have been forced to skip a turn the round before.
- If a player lands on a field with a question he has to answer it. The field determines whether it is an easy or a hard question.
- Answering a question correctly awards the player with points depending on the difficulty of the question. Any shortcuts associated with the field are also allowed to be taken by the player.
